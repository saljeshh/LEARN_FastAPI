## Postgres

- By default every Postgres installation comes with one database already created called "postgres"
- This is important because Postgres requires you to specify the name of a database to make a connection. So there needs to always be one database.

## After Installation

- A table represents a subject or event in an application.
- A UNIQUE constraint can be applied to any column to make sure every record has a unique value for that column.
- By default NULL constraint is applied as any column can be blank.
- NOT NULL constraint can be added to the column to ensure that the column is never left blank.
